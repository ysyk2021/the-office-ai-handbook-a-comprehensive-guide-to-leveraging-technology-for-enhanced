Assess your current capabilities to evaluate any gaps that may hinder progress towards achieving office goals. Evaluate the existing tools, systems, and data that can be leveraged for AI implementation. Determine if there is a need for external support or additional training for employees.

Prioritize Office Goals and Objectives

Prioritize office goals and objectives based on their level of impact and urgency. Consider factors such as cost savings, efficiency gains, and competitive advantages. Develop a roadmap for addressing these goals and objectives over time, starting with those that provide the most significant impact.
